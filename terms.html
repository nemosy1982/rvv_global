    <h2 id="definitions">1. Definitions</h2>
    <p>For the purposes of these Terms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>"Customer"</strong> means any person or entity that purchases, subscribes to, or uses the Services.</li>

    </p>

    <h2 id="eligibility">3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You represent and warrant that you have legal capacity to enter into binding contracts, are not prohibited from using the Services by any applicable law, and — if using the Services on behalf of an organization — you have authority to bind that organization.</p>

    <h2 id="access">4. Access, Registration & Accounts</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="services">5. Services, Orders & Change Management</h2>
    <p>
      RV&V provides a range of services (consulting, ICT, renewable energy, training, projects, products). Specific terms (scope, deliverables, timelines, fees) will be set out in a quotation, proposal, purchase order or service agreement for each engagement.
    </p>
    <h3>5.1 Quotations and acceptance</h3>
    <p>
      Written quotations are valid for the period stated. An accepted quotation becomes a Contract when RV&V issues an acceptance, invoice, or starts work per the agreed terms.
    </p>
    <h3>5.2 Change control</h3>
    <p>
      Changes to scope or deliverables must be agreed in writing. Additional work may require schedule adjustments and additional charges.
    </p>
    <h3>5.3 Service levels & delivery</h3>
    <p>
      Where a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is included, it will specify performance metrics and remedies. SLAs do not apply unless expressly included in the Contract.
    </p>

    <p>
      RV&V may engage subcontractors to perform all or part of the Services. RV&V remains responsible for the subcontractor’s performance and compliance with these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2 id="procurement">6. Procurement, Hardware & Installation</h2>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Site readiness and permits are the Customer's responsibility unless expressly included in the Contract.</li>
      <li>Installation dates may change due to weather, access, or regulatory delays — RV&V will promptly notify the Customer.</li>
      <li>Warranty periods for goods are defined in the Contract; third-party manufacturer warranties may apply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="payments">7. Pricing, Payments & Taxes</h2>

    </p>
    <h3>7.3 Late payments</h3>

    </p>
    <h3>7.4 Refunds & cancellations</h3>
    <p>
      Refund and cancellation rights depend on the Service. For training and events, cancellations within a specified notice period may incur fees. For professional services, cancellations after work commencement may incur charges for work completed and costs incurred.

    <h3>7.5 Taxes</h3>
    <p>
      The Customer is responsible for all applicable taxes (excluding RV&V's income tax). Where RV&V must collect or withhold taxes, it will be charged to the Customer.
    </p>

    <h2 id="delivery-acceptance">8. Delivery, Acceptance & Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Deliverables will be delivered per the Contract. The Customer must notify RV&V of any defects within the agreed acceptance period. Failure to notify in the acceptance period will be deemed acceptance.
    </p>

    <h2 id="warranties">9. Warranties & Disclaimers</h2>
    <h3>9.1 RV&V warranties</h3>
    <p>
      RV&V warrants that Services will be performed with reasonable skill and care and in substantial conformity with the agreed specifications. For physical goods, RV&V will pass through any manufacturer warranties where available.

    <h3>10.1 RV&V IP</h3>

      All intellectual property rights in RV&V content, software, documentation, trademarks and Deliverables created prior to or outside the scope of a Contract remain the exclusive property of RV&V or its licensors.
    </p>
    <h3>10.2 Licensed Deliverables</h3>

    <p>
      The Customer retains ownership of its pre-existing materials. By providing User Content to RV&V the Customer grants RV&V a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, copy, modify, and process such content to provide the Services and for improvement and development purposes, unless otherwise agreed in writing.
    </p>
    <h3>10.4 Open source & third-party components</h3>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2 id="user-content">11. User Content, Acceptable Use & Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for your User Content. You must not submit content that is illegal, infringing, abusive, hateful, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable. RV&V may remove or disable access to User Content at its discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      You agree not to misuse the Services, attempt to breach security, reverse-engineer software (except to the extent permitted by law), or use the Services to store or transmit harmful material.
    </p>

    <h2 id="privacy">12. Privacy & Data Protection</h2>
    <p>
      RV&V's <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> explains how we collect, use and protect personal data. For data processing under a Contract, RV&V will act as controller or processor as specified in the Contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where personal data is processed, RV&V shall implement reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect personal data. The Customer must ensure it has lawful grounds for providing personal data to RV&V and for RV&V’s processing activities.
    </p>

    <h2 id="security">13. Security & Confidentiality</h2>
    <h3>13.1 Security measures</h3>
    <p>
      RV&V will implement commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect data. However, no system is perfectly secure, and RV&V does not guarantee absolute security.
    </p>
    <h3>13.2 Confidential information</h3>
    <p>
      Each party will keep confidential information of the other and not disclose it except to permitted persons, as required by law, or with written consent. Confidential information excludes information that is or becomes public without breach, independently developed, or rightfully obtained from a third party.
    </p>

    <h2 id="thirdparties">14. Third-Party Services & Links</h2>
    <p>
      The Services may integrate or link to third-party services (payment gateways, cloud hosts, analytics). RV&V is not responsible for third-party services’ performance, policies, or content. Use of such services may be subject to additional terms.
    </p>

    <h2 id="advertising">15. Advertising, Testimonials & Endorsements</h2>
    <p>
      RV&V may use Customer names and non-confidential project summaries in its marketing and case studies. If you object to such usage, notify RV&V in writing. Testimonials and endorsements used by RV&V will be used with permission.
    </p>

    <h2 id="compliance">16. Export Controls, Sanctions & Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to comply with all applicable export, import, sanctions and anti-corruption laws. RV&V will not be liable for Customer’s failure to obtain permits or comply with such laws.
    </p>

    <h2 id="insurance">17. Insurance</h2>
    <p>
      Where applicable, the Customer will maintain appropriate insurance coverage (including professional indemnity, public liability, and product liability) and provide evidence on request.
    </p>

    <h2 id="liability">18. Limitation of Liability & Indemnity</h2>
    <h3>18.1 Indemnity</h3>
    <p>
      The Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless RV&V against any third-party claims arising from Customer’s breach of these Terms, misuse of Services, or infringement arising from Customer Content, except to the extent caused by RV&V's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
    </p>
    <h3>18.2 Limitation of liability</h3>
    <p>
      Except for liability that cannot be limited by law (e.g., death or personal injury caused by negligence, wilful misconduct, fraud), RV&V's aggregate liability under or in connection with these Terms will not exceed the total amounts paid by the Customer to RV&V under the specific Contract giving rise to the claim in the 12 months preceding the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      In no event will RV&V be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive or exemplary damages, including loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill or anticipated savings, even if RV&V has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    </p>

    <h2 id="term-termination">19. Termination & Suspension</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>For cause:</strong> Either party may terminate a Contract for material breach if the breach is not remedied within a reasonable cure period after written notice.</li>
      <li><strong>For insolvency:</strong> Either party may suspend or terminate if the other becomes insolvent or subject to insolvency proceedings.</li>
      <li><strong>Effects of termination:</strong> On termination, the Customer will pay for all Services performed and non-cancellable commitments. Sections that by their nature survive termination (IP, confidentiality, indemnity, limitation) will continue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="force-majeure">20. Force Majeure</h2>
    <p>
      Neither party will be liable for failure or delay due to causes beyond reasonable control (acts of God, strikes, civil unrest, pandemic, government action, cyber incidents, supply chain disruptions). The affected party must promptly notify the other and use reasonable efforts to resume performance.
    </p>

    <h2 id="dispute">21. Dispute Resolution & Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (or such jurisdiction as may be specified in a Contract). The parties will attempt to resolve disputes amicably through negotiation within 30 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      If negotiation fails, the dispute will be referred to mediation in Lagos, Nigeria. If mediation does not resolve the dispute within 60 days, the dispute shall be finally resolved by arbitration administered in Lagos under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (or other agreed arbitration rules). The arbitral award is final and binding. Where a party seeks urgent injunctive relief, that party may approach the courts.
    </p>

    <h2 id="consumer-rights">22. Consumer Rights & Local Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      If you are a consumer or resident of a jurisdiction providing mandatory statutory consumer rights (such as the right to certain refunds, cooling-off periods, or specific privacy protections), those local laws apply to the extent they cannot be excluded by agreement. Contact RV&V for country-specific provisions.
    </p>

    <h2 id="modifications">23. Changes to Services & Terms</h2>
    <p>
      RV&V may update or modify the Services and these Terms. Material changes will be posted or notified and will apply from the effective date stated. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
