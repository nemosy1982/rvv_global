    <h2>7. Third-Party Services & Links</h2>
    <p>
      Our website and services may include links to third-party sites, services and widgets (e.g., payment gateways, social networks, video hosts). These third parties have their own privacy practices.
      We are not responsible for their content or practices. Please review their privacy policies before providing personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>8. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      RV&V is an international business. Personal data may be transferred, stored or processed in countries outside your jurisdiction (including countries without the same level of data protection).
      Where transfers are necessary, we will implement appropriate safeguards (standard contractual clauses, data processing agreements, binding corporate rules or other lawful mechanisms).
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes set out in this policy, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
      Specific retention periods depend on the nature of the data (e.g., financial records, recruitment data, user accounts). If you want details on retention periods for a specific category of data, contact the Data Protection Officer (see Contact section).
    </p>

    <h2>10. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
      Measures include encrypted connections (HTTPS), access controls, data minimisation, staff training, and periodic security testing.
      While we strive to protect your information, no system is completely secure — if a breach occurs, we will follow applicable notification laws and inform affected individuals and regulators as required.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Children</h2>
    <p>
      Our services are not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without parental or guardian consent. If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal data of a child, please contact us immediately and we will take steps to remove that information.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <p>The rights listed below depend on jurisdiction and may require identity verification. Where rights exist under applicable law, you may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access:</strong> request a copy of personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li><strong>Rectification:</strong> request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li><strong>Erasure:</strong> request deletion of personal data where there is no legal reason to retain it (the "right to be forgotten").</li>
      <li><strong>Restriction:</strong> request restriction of processing for certain purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Object:</strong> object to processing based on legitimate interests, including profiling for direct marketing.</li>
      <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> request transfer of your data to another provider in a structured, commonly used format.</li>
      <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> when processing is based on consent, you may withdraw that consent at any time (this will not affect processing already carried out lawfully).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To exercise rights, please contact our Data Protection Officer at the details below. We will respond within the timeline required by applicable law (where one exists).
    </p>

    <h2>13. Specific Notices for EU / EEA (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>
      If you are located in the European Economic Area, the lawful bases for our processing are set out above (contract, legal obligation, consent, legitimate interests).
      You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection regulator. We process personal data in accordance with the GDPR where applicable.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Specific Notices for Residents of California (CCPA / CPRA-style)</h2>
    <p>
      California residents may have additional rights regarding the personal information we collect, including the right to request disclosures about categories of personal information collected, sold, or disclosed for a business purpose,
      and the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information (if any). RV&V does not knowingly "sell" personal information as defined under CCPA without providing consumer choice.
      For requests under California law, please contact us using the contact details below and state "California privacy request".
    </p>

    <h2>15. Automated Decision-Making & Profiling</h2>
    <p>
      We generally do not make decisions based solely on automated processing that have legal or similarly significant effects. If we do use automated profiling or make automated decisions (for example in candidate screening or targeted marketing),
      you will be informed, and we will provide information about the logic involved and your rights to object or request human review where required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>16. Marketing & Communications</h2>
    <p>
      We may contact you with newsletters, event invitations, and marketing about our services. You can opt-out at any time through unsubscribe links in emails or by contacting us directly.
      We may send transactional messages (service updates, confirmations) which are necessary for the service and are not marketing.
